# Density-based-Traffic-Control-System
Designed and implemented a density-based traffic control system using an ultrasonic sensor and microcontroller logic to dynamically adjust signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. Vehicle density was inferred using distance measurements as a proxy, enabling adaptive green signal durations for low, medium, and high traffic scenarios.
